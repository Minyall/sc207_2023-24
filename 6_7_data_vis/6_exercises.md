# 6 - Data Visualisation - Lab Exercises
Create a new cell for each question.

## Setup
If starting a new notebook, ensure you have run the following code.
```
import seaborn as sns
titanic_df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')
titanic_df['pclass'] = titanic_df['pclass'].astype('category')

```

## Section 1
### Exercise 1.1
Using Seaborn and your `titanic_df` dataframe, create a `count` plot that shows the number of passengers that embarked at each `embark_town`. Where did the majority of passengers embark?

### Exercise 1.2
Make the same plot as above, but split the data so that it is coloured by `pclass`. What was the majority class of the passengers that embarked in Queenstown?

### Exercise 1.3


### Exercise 1.4


### Exercise 1.5
