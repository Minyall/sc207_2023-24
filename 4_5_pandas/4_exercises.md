# 4 - Pandas - Lab Exercises
Create a new cell for each question. You will need the file `movie_dataset.csv` from Moodle. Whilst each question has a single correct solution/answer, there may be multiple ways to arrive to it.

## Section 1
### Exercise 1.1
Use Pandas to load the file `movie_dataset.csv`. Assign it to a variable called `movies`.

### Exercise 1.2
Find out some basic information about `movies`. How many rows of data are there, how many columns? Are there columns that have missing data for some rows?

### Exercise 1.3
What are the names of the columns between `vote_average` and `crew`?

### Exercise 1.4
What are the first and last movies listed in the dataset?

### Exercise 1.5
Sort the dataset by `budget`. Which is the film with the largest budget? By default Pandas will sort lowest to highest, but can you find a way to reverse this behaviour? Try Googling or looking at the Pandas documentation for the solution. 

### Exercise 1.6
What is the tagline for the film at index `3002`?
